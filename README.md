## Hi there 👋

I’m an SRE Engineer with hands-on experience supporting cloud infrastructure using AWS and Terraform. Alongside my SRE work, I’m actively strengthening my skills in Python and SQL to build more effective automation, improve operational visibility, and support data-driven decision making.
